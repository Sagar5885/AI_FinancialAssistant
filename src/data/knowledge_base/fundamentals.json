    "content": "Compound interest is interest earned on interest, creating exponential wealth growth over time.\n\nHow Compound Interest Works:\nYear 1: $1,000 invested at 7% = $70 interest\nYear 2: $1,070 at 7% = $74.90 interest (earning interest on interest!)\nYear 3: $1,144.90 at 7% = $80.14 interest\nResult: Money grows faster over time\n\nTime Impact (Starting with $10,000 at 7%):\n10 years: $19,672\n20 years: $38,697\n30 years: $76,123\n40 years: $149,745\n50 years: $294,204\n\nKey Factors:\n1. Principal: Starting amount\n2. Interest Rate: Annual return\n3. Time: Years until withdrawal\n4. Frequency: How often interest compounds\n\nMaximizing Compound Interest:\n\u2713 Start early (even small amounts compound)\n\u2713 Add regularly (dollar-cost averaging)\n\u2713 Minimize taxes (retirement accounts)\n\u2713 Keep costs low (low-fee funds)\n\u2713 Don't withdraw early\n\u2713 Be patient\n\nStarting Early Example:\nAt 25: Invest $5,000/year until 65\nAt 35: Invest $5,000/year until 65\nDifference: $300,000+ more by age 65!\n\nKey Takeaway:\nTime is your most valuable asset. Start investing early, even with small amounts.",
